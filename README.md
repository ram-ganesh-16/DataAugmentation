# DataAugmentation
This is the repository that is been created to store the images of the Data that I had been Augmented for the 100 and 500 INR. This is 
the project that I had been working under the organization of National Cash Register with the gudiance of Vinod one of the data analytics
in the organization.

We are trying to train the model in a such a manner so that it can find out the 100 and 500 INR with an accuracy of 95 and even more.

This repository stores the Augmented images of 100 and 500 INR so that we can store the respective data and use it for training the model that
we had been created.
